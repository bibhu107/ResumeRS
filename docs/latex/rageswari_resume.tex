% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
